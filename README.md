# Proposal
Proposal for Turtle Trip for Final Project 
# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Turtle's Trip

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that lets a turtle travel over obstacles and explore the city. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use turtle in python to manuver the scene, but the player will chose the outcome by choosing a number. Each number will display a different task that mario will perform. The numbers will act as forward motion, backwards motion, jump, and speed run. There will be obsticles along the way, like stairs, hills, building, circles, and other obstacles that the player will have to navigate. Turtle will end at the end of the city by the players navigtion. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will at least accomplish the turle function moving along  scene, acting more like a movie than a game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will define some code that will allow the user to make a decision for some of the game instead of the whole game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to make the whole game dictated by the user's decision, they will chose the action they want the turtle to move. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will research and relook at some labs and textbook examples of the turtle function, how to make stairs, how to define functions inside eachother, and how to make circles in python. I am also going to research how to connect motions using specific inputs to a function. Also, I will need to research how to make the turle a differnt shape; maybe something fun.
